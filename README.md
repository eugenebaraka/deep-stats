# Deep Understanding of Statistical Concepts

In this repo, I will be going back to basic statistics with a goal to understand common statistical concepts necessary for everyday data analysis. The jupyter notebooks for my analyses will be in this repo and I will post an article on my [blog](https://eugenebaraka.github.io/) for each analysis. 

Here is the list of the analyses done so far
