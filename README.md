# Deep Understanding of Statistics

In this repo, I will be going back to basic statistics with a goal to have a deep understanding of topics instead of just knowing them. The jupyter notebooks for my analyses will be in this repo and I will try to post an article on my [blog](eugenebaraka.github.io) for each analysis. 

Here is the list of the analyses done so far


| Topic      | Jupyter notebook | Blog post
| ----------- | ----------- |---------------|
| Variance      | [Here](/assets/variance.ipynb) | [Understanding Population Variance and Sample Variance Formulas](https://eugenebaraka.github.io/blog/2022/07/03/variance-explained/)|
