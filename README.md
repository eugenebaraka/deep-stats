# Measures of Dispersion Explained 

## Variance

Variance is a numberical value that explains how far away data points are from the mean, and hence from each other. 
- A variance of zero means all data is similar (we have only one data point)
- The higher the variance, the more disperse our data is (the data points are far away from the mean and from each other)
- The lower the variance, the less disperse the data is (data points close to the mean and to each other)
- Variance cannot be negative!

As discussed above, variance is a distance. So it is calculated as the mean of the squared distances from the mean. 

Let's consider the figure below.
